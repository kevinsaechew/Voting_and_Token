# Voting_and_Token

This project makes use of a local blockchain (Ganache) and an interface to illustrate the value of a particular node.

The project was a proof of concept for a network of ideas. People would be able to add value to someone's map of associations
by upvoting a node and sending a cryptocurrency to it via a transaction.

Eventually this can turn into an artistic or educational project. People may create maps of their associations and then save
and export them for others to see. The public can then upvote or downvote particular nodes/maps with live transactions.
